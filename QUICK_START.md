# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - SQLite Version

This guide will get you up and running with the School Management System using SQLite (no MySQL installation required).

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

- **No MySQL Required**: Using SQLite database (file-based)
- **No Database Setup**: Automatically creates database and tables
- **No Environment Variables**: Works out of the box
- **Same Features**: All functionality preserved

## 🎯 **Quick Setup (3 Steps)**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Start the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Open Browser**
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

The application will:
- ✅ Automatically create SQLite database (`school_management.db`)
- ✅ Create the schools table
- ✅ Handle image uploads to `/public/schoolImages/`
- ✅ Work with all form validations
- ✅ Display schools in responsive grid

## 📁 **Files Created**

- `school_management.db` - SQLite database file
- `public/schoolImages/` - Uploaded images directory

## 🔄 **Switching Back to MySQL**

If you want to use MySQL later:

1. Install MySQL Server
2. Create `.env.local` with database credentials
3. Replace `lib/db-sqlite.ts` with `lib/db.js`
4. Update API routes to use MySQL

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Port Already in Use**
- Next.js will automatically use the next available port
- Check terminal output for the correct URL

### **Image Upload Issues**
- Ensure `public/schoolImages/` directory exists
- Check file permissions

### **Database Issues**
- Delete `school_management.db` to reset database
- Restart the application

## 📱 **Features Working**

- ✅ Add School Form with validation
- ✅ Image upload and storage
- ✅ Schools Gallery with responsive grid
- ✅ Form validation (email, phone, required fields)
- ✅ Success/error feedback
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

## 🎯 **Test the Application**

1. **Add a School**: Fill out the form and upload an image
2. **View Schools**: Navigate to `/showSchools` to see the gallery
3. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and desktop
